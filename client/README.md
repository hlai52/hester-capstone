## Deeper Explanation of App

This is a tablet & desktop responsive tool aimed to be used daily. It is not mobile responsive as the tools being used would not be ideal for a mobile as it aims to have the user sit for a certain period of time and conduct work at their workstation, not on the go as it requires screen space also. It would not be possible to show it on a mobile and be working.

## Inspiration

In a instant culture culture and time for instaneous is everything, how come we donâ€™t apply it to our personal lives of daily tasks? I want to bring awareness on the present moment and remove the emotion of feeling overwhelmed and end the cycle of non-productiveness in a casual way.
I was inspired by my classmates and their pomodoro study sessions. I found the fast pace speed of the bootcamp to be overwhelming for some of us and I wanted to solve that pain point. By offering the to do list to be stored locally or in a database for the user's customization. The work corner is stored in local session and will be erased as it promotes and motivates those to start and complete their task in the work corner.
