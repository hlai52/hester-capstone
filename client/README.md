- Created by Hester Lai

## Steps to Run Program

1. Install node.JS
   Version v18.12.1
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Open the file
   Run command LS to see that there is client and api folder available.

3. CD into API folder
   Run CD into the API folder.
   Run command npm i to install all necessary modules.

4. CD into client folder
   Run CD into Client folder.
   Run command npm i to install everything.

5. Open a new terminal
   Run command CD into API folder.
   When inside API folder, run command npm start server.

You should see "Server is running on port#.." and "Connected to MongoDB"

6. Open a new terminal
   Run command CD into Client folder.
   When inside client folder, run command npm start.

7. If you wish to use local storage simply change the current ".env" file to ".env.database and take the .env.local file and change it to ".env" and it should let you store the todo list function locally.

## Features

There is a to-do list function which lets you store all the things you enter either locally or in a database. This CRUD feature lets you create, read, update and delete the to do list task.

In the work corner, you are given space to conduct your work. Your to-do list is there and there is a small work corner with a timer where it's locally stored as the intention of the work corner is to accompolish what you need and it's meant to be done right there and done. This is to encourage users to complete all the task that they want in the work corner. In the side it shows when the last task was completed. There is also a pomodoro style timer to let users define their work time for each task or break, customizable with a +/- 5 minute break.

Underneath, there is also a music section for the users to work along or to relax and have a break.

## Stack Used

Javascript
React
NodeJS
MongoD DB(data storage)
Azure Cosmos DB or locally(change .env file in steps to run)

## Deeper Explanation of App

This is a tablet & desktop responsive tool aimed to be used daily. It is not mobile responsive as the tools being used would not be ideal for a mobile as it aims to have the user sit for a certain period of time and conduct work at their workstation, not on the go as it requires screen space also. It would not be possible to show it on a mobile and be working.

## Inspiration

In a instant culture culture and time for instaneous is everything, how come we donâ€™t apply it to our personal lives of daily tasks? I want to bring awareness on the present moment and remove the emotion of feeling overwhelmed and end the cycle of non-productiveness in a casual way.
I was inspired by my classmates and their pomodoro study sessions. I found the fast pace speed of the bootcamp to be overwhelming for some of us and I wanted to solve that pain point. By offering the to do list to be stored locally or in a database for the user's customization. The work corner is stored in local session and will be erased as it promotes and motivates those to start and complete their task in the work corner.

### Lessons Learnt

A lot of lessons were learnt here, from how to style, code and learning something new like MongoDB and Cosmos DB. One of the lessons I've learnt is to commit more to Github and be more familiar with the Github commands as I had an issue with a repo a few days in and I ended up just creating a new one. This project allowed me the freedom to test and try things which was great and I feel like I learnt a lot and how to ask for help.

### Next Steps

Clean up the code and have all code consistent with PX/REM and SASS and CSS. Time did not allow me to convert more. I am hoping to add a journal section too.
